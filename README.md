This program is a simple calculator written in Python. It can perform the following basic arithmetic operations:

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)

**How to use:**

1. **Run the program:** Save the code in a `.py` file and run it using the `python` command in the terminal.
2. **Enter numbers:** The program will ask you to enter two numbers. Make sure to enter valid numeric values (e.g., 10, 3.14).
3. **Choose the operation:** After entering the two numbers, the program will ask you to enter the symbol for the operation you want to perform ( +, -, *, / ).
4. **View the result:** The program will calculate the result and display it on the screen.
5. **Perform another operation (optional):** The program will ask you after each operation if you want to perform another operation. Enter `y` to continue or `n` to exit the program.

**Notes:**

* The program currently does not support exponents, roots, and other complex calculations.
* You cannot divide any number by zero. The program will display an error message if you try to do so.
